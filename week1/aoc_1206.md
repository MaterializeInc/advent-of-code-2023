## Part one

```sql
WITH options AS
(
	SELECT
	  (floor((time - sqrt(time * time - 4 * record)) / 2) + 1)::int low,
	  (ceil((time + sqrt(time * time - 4 * record)) / 2) - 1)::int hi,
	FROM input
)
SELECT exp(sum(ln(hi - low + 1)))::int
FROM options;
```

## Part one + two in one go!

```sql
WITH MUTUALLY RECURSIVE

    ties(slower NUMERIC, faster NUMERIC) AS (
        SELECT
            (time + sqrt(time * time - 4 * distance)) / 2 as slower,
            (time - sqrt(time * time - 4 * distance)) / 2 as faster
        FROM input
    ),
    options(choices NUMERIC) AS (
        SELECT 1 + FLOOR(slower)::NUMERIC - CEIL(faster)::NUMERIC FROM ties
    ),
    part12(part12 NUMERIC) AS (
        SELECT pow(10.0, SUM(log(choices))) FROM options
    )

SELECT * FROM part12;
```
