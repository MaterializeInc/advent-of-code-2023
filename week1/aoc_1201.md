## Part one

> The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line
> originally contained a specific calibration value that the Elves now need to
> recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the
> first digit and the last digit (in that order) to form a single two-digit
> number.
>
> Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the
  calibration values?

```sql
SELECT SUM(LEFT(r, 1)::int * 10 + RIGHT(r, 1)::int) AS part1
FROM (
	SELECT regexp_replace(input, '[^\d]', '', 'g') AS r
	FROM aoc_1201
);
```

## Part two

> Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are
> actually spelled out with letters: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
> eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".
>
> Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and
> last digit on each line.

```sql
WITH
    lines AS (
        SELECT regexp_split_to_table(input, '\n') AS line
        FROM aoc_1201
    ),
    slices AS (
        SELECT line, index, substring(line, index, width) AS slice
        FROM
            lines,
            generate_series(1, length(line)) AS index,
            generate_series(1, 5) AS width
    ),
    numbers (t, n) AS (
        VALUES ('0', 0), ('1', 1), ('2', 2), ('3', 3), ('4', 4), ('5', 5), ('6', 6), ('7', 7), ('8', 8), ('9', 9),
